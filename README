DUNKbonds is a platform upon which anyone can create a prediction market for their personal goal.  
Each goal sets up its own prediction market which could be used to promote charitable giving and provides the goalsetter a sense of how his supporters and challengers feel about the likelihood of him meeting his goal.  
Supporters and Challengers compete to try to beat the market by participating in the market.  
Goalsetters can communicate with their supporters and challengers through blog and email updates so as to provide adequate market information.

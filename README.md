Note: I wrote this app in the 2012-2013 timespan. I still own the dunkbonds.com domain but leave the site in maintenance mode. I decided to make the repo public to beef up my code portfolio.  Below is the legacy README:

DUNKbonds is a platform upon which anyone can create a prediction market for their personal goal.  
Each goal has its own prediction market which can be used to promote charitable giving and provides the goalsetter a sense of how their supporters and challengers feel about the likelihood meeting the goal.  
Supporters and Challengers square off in the prediction market for bragging rights.  
Goalsetters can communicate with their supporters and challengers through blog and email updates so as to provide adequate market information.  

My goal was to dunk a basketball before a certain date about two years in the future (which I did!). The name is a play on junk bonds, because the prediction market sort of functions as a bond market:  the goalsetter issues bonds on the goal, and if met, the goalsetter gets to default!  It functions like a philanthropic scoreboard of sorts where would be bondholders donate if the bonds default.

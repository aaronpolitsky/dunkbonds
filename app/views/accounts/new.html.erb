<h3>Follow <%= @goal.title %>?</h3>

Do you want to follow this goal?  <br>
<small>What this does:  <br>
<ul>
	<li>creates your account with this goal so you can support it by trading its bonds</li>
	<li>shows the goal's blog posts to your home page</li>
</ul>
</small>

<%= render 'form' %>

  The first step to supporting a goal (by buying or trading its DUNKbonds) is to follow it.  Following a goal automatically creates a shiny new account for you so that you might support the goal.  Don't worry--until you support the goal, you can always unfollow it, and that closes the account.</small>
